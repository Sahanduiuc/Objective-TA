# Objective-TA                                                                       
Objective-TA's aim is to be a feature-rich technical analysis library to cater towards a large variety of OOP languages.

The idea for this project came from TA-lib which is a useful library, however because of the way it was created, documentation across languages is poor and the extensibility of the library is very very limited. Objective-TA aims to take a similar approach to TA-lib but adding in easy to use features in TA objects so that signals, trends and other information can be easily linguistically conveyed within an OOP paradigm and so that library objects can be easily and meaningfully extended.

The library is aimed towards independant traders and developers. Objective-TA will offer intially offer support for C#, Java & C++. If the project gains some community support then other languages will be considered such as Python or Ruby.
