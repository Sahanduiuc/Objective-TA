# Objective-TA                                                                       
Objective-TA aims to be a feature-rich technical analysis library to cater towards object-oriented languages.

The idea for this project is to serve as an up-to-date technical analysis library that is well documented & supported across many programming languages. Objective-TA is similar to TA-lib but has easy to use features such as TA objects that can be used to convey signals, trends and other information. It also relies heavily on type inference and extensiblity so that there is as little restriction on how the library is used as possible.

Objective-TA is currently being developed for C#, Java & C++.

#### Current version: Under Development (see master branch for latest code updates)
