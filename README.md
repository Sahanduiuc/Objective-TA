# Objective-TA                                                                       
Objective-TA's aim is to be a feature-rich technical analysis library to cater towards OOP languages.

The idea for this project is to serve as a modern technical analysis software library that is well documented & supported across many object-oriented programming languages. Objective-TA is similar to TA-lib but has added easy to use features such as TA objects that can be used to convey signals, trends and other information.

Objective-TA currently supports C#, C++ & Java with more to come in future.

### Current version: N/A (see dev branch for latest code updates)
